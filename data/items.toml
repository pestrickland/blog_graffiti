alt = "A splash of colour"
description = "Decorating a nearby subway, this bright green really stands out. I'm not sure if the black tag goes alongside the piece, but I don't think it detracts from it."

description = "This wall is a well-used canvas, and the location of several large pieces. The use of the yellow diagonals is intriguing."

thumb = "images/thumbs/4.jpg"
alt = "Thumbs up"
description = "By restricting the palette, the emphasis shifts to shape and contrast, but ultimately it is the expression in this example that makes it stand out."

image = "images/full/5.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/5.jpg"
alt = "Bleak"
description = "Not a great deal can be said about this. With so much space comes so much potential, but ultimately it is wasted here. Whilst there is clearly some pride in the artist's work, a major improvement would be seen by the use of correct spelling."

title = "Mosaic"
image = "images/full/6f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/6t.jpg"
alt = "Mosaic"
description = "The tiled background adds nearly all the interest here. A couple of other notable features are the styling of the initial character (an 'M'?), and the curious upside-down Amazon smile."

[[items]]
title = "Loud"
image = "images/full/7f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/7t.jpg"
alt = "Loud"
description = "A slightly faded example of stencilling. One wonders whether the location of this piece was intended to convey meaning, being placed above the entrance to a fairly low underpass that often causes people to duck down. And what about its proximity to the pedestrian sign?"

[[items]]
title = "Cobbles"
image = "images/full/8f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/8t.jpg"
alt = "Cobbles"
description = "I've always wondered why graffiti tends to be limited to walls. I've also wondered if this is, in fact, graffiti or if it's actually the markings for some road works. I like to embrace wonder on occasion."

[[items]]
title = "Corn"
image = "images/full/9f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/9t.jpg"
alt = "Corn"
description = "On a run in the countryside, quite far from populated areas and in the snow, what do I find but a half-eaten cob of corn. I was quite unsure what to make of it, and it was quite vivid after seeing nothing but white for an hour or so."

[[items]]
title = "Bench"
image = "images/full/10f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/10t.jpg"
alt = "Bench"
description = "The park bench, in my experience, does not normally attract hashtags, or other graffiti notable enough for me to remember. Perhaps this is a pioneering example."

[[items]]
title = "Bike"
image = "images/full/11f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/11t.jpg"
alt = "Bike"
description = "A rather well-used sign here. I wonder what the criteria are for the replacement of stickers, or indeed whether criteria for any aspect of this enterprise exist. Perhaps it is ironic, or maybe just interesting, that the existence of the graffiti and the stickers, coupled with the faded and somewhat whitewashed brickwork, only serve to increase the prominence of the sign."

[[items]]
title = "Purple"
image = "images/full/12f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/12t.jpg"
alt = "Purple"
description = "Down a quiet footpath we find a fairly large piece that stands alone. As such it stands out, although I can't help but feel that this is somewhat unfinished, or doesn't reach its potential. It's clear and bold, yes, with a touch of intricacy with the layered lettering, but one is left wondering if that was really the best that could be done."

[[items]]
title = "Brick"
image = "images/full/13f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/13t.jpg"
alt = "Brick"
description = "A rural railway bridge provides the background for this example. Clearly an aged piece, the brickwork has been repaired since the paint was first applied. One can only imagine how this might have looked in its prime."

[[items]]
title = "Bubbles"
image = "images/full/14f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/14t.jpg"
alt = "Bubbles"
description = "The local subway received a new coat of white paint, and this was soon added. It's gone now, stripped off in a way that may actually be unsanctioned by the local authorities given the stench of domestic paint that haunts the place now. Anyway, I particularly enjoyed the little details added within the letters. A seaside theme perhaps?"

title = "Letterbox"
image = "images/full/15f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/15t.jpg"
alt = "Letterbox"
description = "Nestled inside a light fitting, this well-framed but diminutive piece suggests a certain shyness in the artist."

[[items]]
title = "On edge"
image = "images/full/16f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/16t.jpg"
alt = "On edge"
description = "A very interesting piece. A new artist perhaps, but almost certainly a new style. I wonder if the combination of the angular, almost block-like facial features and the mosaic background was a deliberate choice? As for the splash of colour, it's hard to decide whether this was part of the original design, or was added afterwards to an otherwise monochrome painting."

[[items]]
title = "Commentary"
image = "images/full/17f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/17t.jpg"
alt = "Commentary"
description = "Clearly not a painting, I almost dismissed this as litter whilst out on a morning run. But observe the arrangement of the items of food: the bag is open to reveal its contents; the straws form an arrow; the chips almost form some letters. Its placement between the surfaced road and the bare earth appears to be deliberate too -- perhaps the direction of the arrow illustrates the relentless march of progress towards modernity, but the rubbish alerts us to the waste that is often left behind."

[[items]]
title = "Roach"
image = "images/full/18f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/18t.jpg"
alt = "Roach"
description = "Quite a prolific motif recently, this has very little to offer the world. With the exception of the arrow-styled 'A', there is no interest offered to the viewer."

[[items]]
title = "Numbers"
image = "images/full/19f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/19t.jpg"
alt = "Numbers"
description = "With a fairly simple palette, it's surprising how much this piece stands out. The numbers of the title take some time to appear to the viewer, and it is unclear if it is 113 or 713. As for the spots or bubble-type features, one is left wondering whether or not they were part of the original design, or an afterthought. Notice too how nature is in conflict with this piece."

[[items]]
title = "Smile"
image = "images/full/20f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/20t.jpg"
alt = "Smile"
description = "An unassuming scribble and diminutive in size, this brightened up an otherwise dull day."

title = "Heart"
image = "images/full/21f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/21t.jpg"
alt = "Heart"
description = "Rarely do we see the use of different mediums in graffiti. Here, the texture of the artwork is as enlightening as the message itself."

[[items]]
title = "Skull"
image = "images/full/22f.jpg"

description = "Quite a clever little piece. Little meaning though."

[[items]]
title = "Negative Space"
image = "images/full/23f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/23t.jpg"
alt = "Negative Space"
description = "This photo does not have the same impact as the actual piece, which struck me by the illusion of the symbols protrayed in negative space. It showed some unique developments among the proliferation of recent tagging"

[[items]]
title = "Evolution"
image = "images/full/24f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/24t.jpg"
alt = "Evolution"
description = "What we see here is an evolution of the Roach tag that was prolific a year or so ago. Is this an exercise in the development of the artist, or a more commercial 'rebranding' activity? There certainly seems to be more technical merit, and the balance is more pleasing to the eye than the original attempt. It is, however, still quite primitive."

[[items]]
title = "Fish"
image = "images/full/25f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/25t.jpg"
alt = "fish"
description = "A fairly simple concept but with a neat execution, the viewer is left with doubt about the meaning of this piece. Note the detail of the crossed-out eye -- a nod to our mortality perhaps?"

[[items]]
title = "Boot?"
image = "images/full/26f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/26t.jpg"
alt = "Boot"
description = "At first glance, this piece is chaotic and looks like an aborted attempt. However, it appears in a similar form in several different spaces, which leads us to consider that it is all deliberate. There are several tropes on show, from the classic spliff-smoker to affinity with anarchic philosophy. But it is still unclear how much of this is intended to baffle the viewer."

[[items]]
title = "Boot 2"
image = "images/full/27f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/27t.jpg"
alt = "Boot 2"
description = "Note the similar motifs present here and the previous image. Whilst not as similar as I first thought, there is clearly a certain style in use on all of our subways..."
