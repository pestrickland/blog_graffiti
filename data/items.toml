description = "Decorating a nearby subway, this bright green really stands out. I'm not sure if the black tag goes alongside the piece, but I don't think it detracts from it."

description = "By restricting the palette, the emphasis shifts to shape and contrast, but ultimately it is the expression in this example that makes it stand out."

alt = "Bleak"
description = "Not a great deal can be said about this. With so much space comes so much potential, but ultimately it is wasted here. Whilst there is clearly some pride in the artist's work, a major improvement would be seen by the use of correct spelling."

title = "Mosaic"
image = "images/full/6f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/6t.jpg"
alt = "Mosaic"
description = "The tiled background adds nearly all the interest here. A couple of other notable features are the styling of the initial character (an 'M'?), and the curious upside-down Amazon smile."

title = "Loud"
image = "images/full/7f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/7t.jpg"
alt = "Loud"
description = "A slightly faded example of stencilling. One wonders whether the location of this piece was intended to convey meaning, being placed above the entrance to a fairly low underpass that often causes people to duck down. And what about its proximity to the pedestrian sign?"

title = "Cobbles"
image = "images/full/8f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/8t.jpg"
alt = "Cobbles"
description = "I've always wondered why graffiti tends to be limited to walls. I've also wondered if this is, in fact, graffiti or if it's actually the markings for some road works. I like to embrace wonder on occasion."

thumb = "images/thumbs/9t.jpg"
alt = "Corn"
description = "On a run in the countryside, quite far from populated areas and in the snow, what do I find but a half-eaten cob of corn. I was quite unsure what to make of it, and it was quite vivid after seeing nothing but white for an hour or so."

alt = "Bench"
description = "The park bench, in my experience, does not normally attract hashtags, or other graffiti notable enough for me to remember. Perhaps this is a pioneering example."

title = "Bike"
image = "images/full/11f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/11t.jpg"
alt = "Bike"
description = "A rather well-used sign here. I wonder what the criteria are for the replacement of stickers, or indeed whether criteria for any aspect of this enterprise exist. Perhaps it is ironic, or maybe just interesting, that the existence of the graffiti and the stickers, coupled with the faded and somewhat whitewashed brickwork, only serve to increase the prominence of the sign."

title = "Purple"
image = "images/full/12f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/12t.jpg"
alt = "Purple"
description = "Down a quiet footpath we find a fairly large piece that stands alone. As such it stands out, although I can't help but feel that this is somewhat unfinished, or doesn't reach its potential. It's clear and bold, yes, with a touch of intricacy with the layered lettering, but one is left wondering if that was really the best that could be done."

title = "Brick"
image = "images/full/13f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/13t.jpg"
alt = "Brick"
description = "A rural railway bridge provides the background for this example. Clearly an aged piece, the brickwork has been repaired since the paint was first applied. One can only imagine how this might have looked in its prime."

thumb = "images/thumbs/14t.jpg"
alt = "Bubbles"
description = "The local subway received a new coat of white paint, and this was soon added. It's gone now, stripped off in a way that may actually be unsanctioned by the local authorities given the stench of domestic paint that haunts the place now. Anyway, I particularly enjoyed the little details added within the letters. A seaside theme perhaps?"

description = "Nestled inside a light fitting, this well-framed but diminutive piece suggests a certain shyness in the artist."

title = "On edge"
image = "images/full/16f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/16t.jpg"
alt = "On edge"
description = "A very interesting piece. A new artist perhaps, but almost certainly a new style. I wonder if the combination of the angular, almost block-like facial features and the mosaic background was a deliberate choice? As for the splash of colour, it's hard to decide whether this was part of the original design, or was added afterwards to an otherwise monochrome painting."

title = "Commentary"
image = "images/full/17f.jpg"
thumb = "images/thumbs/17t.jpg"
alt = "Commentary"
description = "Clearly not a painting, I almost dismissed this as litter whilst out on a morning run. But observe the arrangement of the items of food: the bag is open to reveal its contents; the straws form an arrow; the chips almost form some letters. Its placement between the surfaced road and the bare earth appears to be deliberate too -- perhaps the direction of the arrow illustrates the relentless march of progress towards modernity, but the rubbish alerts us to the waste that is often left behind."
