description = "Not a great deal can be said about this. With so much space comes so much potential, but ultimately it is wasted here. Whilst there is clearly some pride in the artist's work, a major improvement would be seen by the use of correct spelling."

description = "The tiled background adds nearly all the interest here. A couple of other notable features are the styling of the initial character (an 'M'?), and the curious upside-down Amazon smile."

alt = "Loud"
description = "A slightly faded example of stencilling. One wonders whether the location of this piece was intended to convey meaning, being placed above the entrance to a fairly low underpass that often causes people to duck down. And what about its proximity to the pedestrian sign?"

alt = "Cobbles"
description = "I've always wondered why graffiti tends to be limited to walls. I've also wondered if this is, in fact, graffiti or if it's actually the markings for some road works. I like to embrace wonder on occasion."

alt = "Corn"
description = "On a run in the countryside, quite far from populated areas and in the snow, what do I find but a half-eaten cob of corn. I was quite unsure what to make of it, and it was quite vivid after seeing nothing but white for an hour or so."

alt = "Bike"
description = "A rather well-used sign here. I wonder what the criteria are for the replacement of stickers, or indeed whether criteria for any aspect of this enterprise exist. Perhaps it is ironic, or maybe just interesting, that the existence of the graffiti and the stickers, coupled with the faded and somewhat whitewashed brickwork, only serve to increase the prominence of the sign."
